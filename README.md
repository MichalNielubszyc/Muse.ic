This is a recruitment process project that aim was to create a landing page using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [React](https://pl.reactjs.org/) and [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/).  I created an infinite 3-elements carousel using [React Slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/). The carousel shows 7 Arctic Monkeys albums which are fetched from iTunes API, the album covers are fetched in 1000x1000px resolution. There is also a little bit of [TypeScript](
https://www.typescriptlang.org/) implemented in the project (index.tsx & CarouselSection.tsx). The project was deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Layout was based on design from Figma:  https://www.figma.com/file/Hp7DeUuEGhAoqKoP59eK4V/Recruitment-task?node-id=2%3A6812.
